# Lights Challenge

## Instructions for running
Clone/download this folder.

Run: `node solution`

Input should be in input.txt which should be in the same directory as the solution and the result is printed to the console.

## Expanded solutions
To show some of my working, as the minified/uglified solution is pretty unreadable, I've expanded the solution into a readable format in `expanded-solution.js`.

Previous iterations/drafts to show my process are in `draft-*.js`.
