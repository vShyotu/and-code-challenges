# Challenge 3 - Snake

## Instructions for running

Download the folder
Open index.html in chrome (Developed in chrome - should work in other browsers that support modern JavaScript syntax)

## Controls
Default controls are WASD for movement and E to pause/confirm - the key strings are editable in constants.js (Any valid event.key value would work, e.g. "ArrowUp", "ArrowDown", "ArrowLeft", "ArrowRight").

## Fun fact
This is actually my first time attempting to make games using javascript/html5 canvas. :)
