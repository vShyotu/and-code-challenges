# Up and Atom Challenge

## Instructions for running
Clone/download this folder.

Run: `node solution`

Input should be in `input.txt` which should be in the same directory as the solution and the result is printed to the console.

`elementSymbolLookup.json` should also be present.

## Debug Solution

I also included a debug solution which I used whilst developing to show console logs the steps of the process.
